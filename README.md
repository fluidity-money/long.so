# Long Tail AMM (Superposition AMM) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/fluidity-money/long.so/graph/badge.svg?token=LIRGRUVdTr)](https://codecov.io/gh/fluidity-money/long.so)

Long Tail AMM is Arbitrum's most rewarding AMM, made possible with
Stylus. Long Tail AMM leverages Super Assets to reward every on-chain
transaction with yield, whilst remaining the most affordable AMM with
a low gas profile leveraging Stylus.

Stylus is a WASM frontend to the standard EVM stack made available
exclusively on Arbitrum. The Stylus Rust toolchain leverages LLVM to
produce WASM binaries with support for using the EVM once deployed
on-chain.

Deployment addresses are available at [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

Architecture information is available at [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
